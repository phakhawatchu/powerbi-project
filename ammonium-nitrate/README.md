#### Evaporator

-   A weak solution (around 83%) of NH4NO3 is pump from feed tank to an evaporator.
-   At the top of the evaporator there is a steam ejector vacuum system.
-   The air fed to the system controls the vacuum drawn.
-   Aim of this vacuum evaporator is to increase the concentration to around 95%.

#### Surge Tank

-   The concentrated solution is pumped to a surge tank.
-   The surge tank contains 95% of NH4NO3.
-   The level of surge tank should be controlled.

#### Prilling Tower

-   The concentrated solution is fed into the top of prilling tower.
-   In this tower, the concentrated solution is dropped against a strong updraft of air.
-   The air is supplied by a blower at the bottom of the tower.
-   The air chills the droplets in spherical form and removes part of the moisture. This creates pellets or prills.

#### Dryer

-   The prills are then conveyed to a rotary dryer where they are dried.
-   It is difficult to dry the prills of NH4NO3 as they are deliquescent.
-   Drying temperature must be low to avoid melting.
-   Then go to cooler for cooling down the materials.
